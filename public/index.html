Cheating of any kind will automatically disqualify you from the event.<br><br> 
To prevent an advanced coder from joining the beginner group, we've incentivized the advanced group's prizes to be double the amount and we'll screen submissions and discuss with you if it seems like you belong in a different category.<br><br>Let event staff know if you have any questions or issues

                    MissouriHacks is the first ever high school hackathon hosted by the University of Missouri. Our leadership has experience with managing 1000+ sized events for youth and adults along with experience working with students in a University capacity. We are apart of the Student Organization for the Advancement of Research Education (SOARE) who focus on high school research programs around the state and hosts the regional Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. SOARE is apart of the University of Missouri and is a registered student organization. We also work with TigerHacks who hosts a coding competition yearly for college students.

                    SOARE instills knowledge, curiosity and excitement for STEM in high school students by increasing the accessibility of science research opportunities at the high school level. Students who participate in these high school research programs have the opportunity to complete collegiate level research, compete at international research symposia, and potentially patent or publish their findings. Students who successfully complete a research program in high school gain applicable skills in any career path, network with professionals, and gain tangible experience for university applications.<br><br>We are currently seeking donations to help support the program and allow more opportunity for future events for students interested in STEM. Contributions of any amount are greatly appreciated and will go a long way to guiding students along their college journey and career. Furthermore, funding will go towards students' ideas and projects related to STEM which has the potential to make a positive impact on the community and industry.
